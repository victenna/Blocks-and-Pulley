# Blocks-and-Pulley
Python in high school physics course. For teachers, children and parents who enjoy coding. An animation
presents the motion of the system that consists of the fixed and movable pulleys  and two blocks connected
by a weightless inextensible rope. The acceleration value and motion direction of the blocks depends on the
ratio between the block masses. To write a program, you need to be familiar with basic Python commands, 
Pygame library codes and Newton's basic laws. During the process of creating a program students learn a
programming language and also master school physics and mathematics better. Files for modeling this 
scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
